to use the test system...


REQUIREMENTS:

install on your machine:

java sdk
slapd
mysql (server + client)


run:
	./testj help



infos:

- passwords for ldap+db can be found in the config directory, default should be 'pass'


debugging:

- if your slapd doesn't come up and show a config file error 
  (will happen e.g. on newer ubuntu distributions like oneiric)
  make sure your user is in the system's slapd group, e.g. 'openldap'.
  then logout/login, try again.

- if you don't get any db connection/lfns, check that your /etc/hosts knows both 'localhost' AND 'localhost.localdomain', or 
  in any other case, check that the DB config entries make up sense with mysql -host X -P Y ...
